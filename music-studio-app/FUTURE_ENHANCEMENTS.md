- **Organic Animations**: Flowing, natural movements inspired by wind, water, leaves
- **Particle Systems**: Floating petals, fireflies, light particles
- **Dynamic Gradients**: Time-based color shifts (sunrise, day, sunset, night)

### 🎨 Login Page - "Inner Harmony"
**Theme**: Meditation & Twilight
- Deep twilight gradient (dark blue → purple → indigo)
- Animated meditation silhouette with breathing effect
- Floating lotus petals
- Gentle wave patterns in background
- Moon phases animation
